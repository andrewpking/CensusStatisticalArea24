# Census Statistical Areas

Author: Drew King

## Purpose

Finding geodata on census statistical areas in parseable formats for use with data visualization tools is challenging. There is a need for easier to find and use geodata for non-standard census geographies. csba-2024.topojson was created from a geodata file found on data.census.gov

This file is large, but contains lots of metadata allowing it to be linked to other census data from CSA's, including CSAPopulation-20-23.csv. Having the population of statistical areas can be useful for applications such as transit planning and visualizing this information can result in better mass transit choices to connect us all together.
